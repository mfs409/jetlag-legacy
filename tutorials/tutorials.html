  <h1>JetLag Tutorials</h1>
  <p>
    Below is a list of tutorials related to the JetLag game framework.  After
    you've done the first two or three, the rest can probably be followed in any
    order.  Please contact <a href="https://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~spear/">Mike
    Spear</a> if you find any bugs or have any suggestions.

    <dt><a href="#getting_started.md" target="_blank">Getting Started</a></dt>
    <dd>
      In this tutorial, we will discuss how to get started using JetLag.  This
      tutorial doesn't involve much programming.  It only focuses on getting
      your computer set up to start writing games.  When you finish this
      tutorial, you will have a copy of the JetLag code that you are able to
      run.  You will be able to use this as the starting point for learning
      about games, and also as the starting point for making your own game.
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="#overview.md" target="_blank">An Overview Of JetLag</a></dt>
    <dd>
      This tutorial gives a high-level overview of JetLag.  It briefly describes some
      of the main concepts that you will want to understand as you learn about game
      development, and then it explains how the default game works.
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="#camera_gravity.md" target="_blank">The Camera And Gravity</a></dt>
    <dd>
     In JetLag, the camera decides what part of a level is visible at any
     time.  The camera and gravity work together in interesting ways, which
     we explore in this tutorial.

    <dt><a href="#simulation_conway.md" target="_blank">Introduction To
    Simulation With Conway's Game Of Life</a></dt>
    <dd>
     Conway's Game of Life is a famous simulation.  This tutorial implements
     a version of it in JetLag, as a way to get you thinking about
     simulation.  This tutorial is also useful if you're thinking about
     making a game that doesn't rely on physics, but instead on a sort of
     "game board".
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="#roles.md" target="_blank">Roles that Actors Play</a></dt>
    <dd>
     In JetLag, actors take on roles, like "hero" or "obstacle".  This
     tutorial discusses these roles.
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="#movement_physics.md" target="_blank">Movement and Physics</a></dt>
    <dd>
     This tutorial discusses the physics simulation that underpins all of
     JetLag.  It also introduces different ways of controlling an actor's
     movement.
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="#text_hud.md" target="_blank">Text And The Heads-Up Display</a></dt>
    <dd>
     This tutorial discusses the ways that you can create text that appears
     in your game.  It also introduces the heads-up display (HUD).
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="#assets_audio_animations.md" target="_blank">Assets, Audio,
    and Animations</a></dt>
    <dd>
     This tutorial discusses the different ways that you can control the
     appearance of an Actor.  It also introduces sound effects.
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="#timers.md" target="_blank">Working With Timers</a></dt>
    <dd>
     Timers provide a way to make events happen in the future.  This tutorial
     covers the basics of how to use them.
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="#score.md" target="_blank">Keeping Score</a></dt>
    <dd>
     JetLag tracks a lot of different statistics, which you can use as part
     of the "score" in your game.
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="#stage_transitions.md" target="_blank">Transitions Among Stages</a></dt>
    <dd>
     When you are designing a game, you'll quickly find that putting
     everything in one file is a bad idea.  This tutorial presents one way of
     organizing your code, and also discusses how to transition between the
     different parts of your game.  This tutorial also shows how to do
     background music.
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="#gestures.md" target="_blank">Gesture Input</a></dt>
    <dd>
     Mouse and touch inputs are among the most common ways of interacting
     with a game.  This tutorial explores their use in JetLag.
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="#projectiles.md" target="_blank">Projectiles</a></dt>
    <dd>
     Projectiles are a special role.  This tutorial helps you to understand
     how they work.  It also introduces "actor pools", which help your game
     to run efficiently.
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="#storage.md" target="_blank">Storing Information</a></dt>
