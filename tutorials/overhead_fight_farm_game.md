*** An Overhead Fighting/Farming Game (overhead_fight_farm_game.ts; ready)
**** Overview
This tutorial builds a game where characters move around in an overhead-view
world, fighting, and farming.  It also introduces the projectile type.
**** What goes in here
- This is especially about session storage and the way we make mini-state
  machines all the time.  Also a bit about how to represent state as arrays.
- Be sure to talk about free asset packs, and how I made these assets
- Changing size of sprite, faking things with projectiles
