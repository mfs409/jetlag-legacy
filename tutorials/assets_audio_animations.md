*** Assets, Audio, and Animations (assets_audio_animation; ready)
**** Overview
This tutorial focuses on the key asset types in JetLag: images, sounds, and
sprite sheets.  It briefly discusses texture packing.
**** TODO: What goes in here?
- About color codes for those filledsprites (include transparency)
- The two ways of making animations
- All the different animation states
- The remap concept (ugh) for overriding defaults
- Sounds versus music
- No spaces in names!
- Sounds:
-- Disappear, toss, arrive, defeat, jump, collide
- Changing images/animations without making new components
- Z index!
