*** Introduction to Simulation: Conway's Game of Life (simulation_conway.ts; ready)
**** Overview
This tutorial discusses Conway's Game of Life, as a prelude to the idea that a
game might need to create its own internal simulation (e.g., farming).
**** Plan
- Discuss the rules of Conway
- Introduce the array, and extra
- A state machine for the UI
- A function on the fly
- It should just run itself (the game and the video)
