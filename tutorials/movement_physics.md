*** Movement Styles and Physics Bodies (movement_physics.ts; ready)
**** Overview
This tutorial focuses on the `Movement` field in the constructor for `Actors`.
It also discusses important issues related to rigid body types, physics
properties, gravity, shapes, and tilt.
**** What goes in here
- Dynamic, Kinematic, Static (collisions and forces)
- Sprite size / shape need not match rigidbody
- Friction, Density, Elasticity
- Tilt / impulse / accelerometer
- Movements: StandardMovement, PathMovement, TiltMovement, Projectile,
  BasicChase, Inert, Gravity
