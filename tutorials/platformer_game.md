*** A Platformer Game (platformer_game; ready)
**** Overview
This tutorial builds a platformer-style game.  It introduces the idea of
invincibility, and the different ways a hero can defeat an enemy.
**** Missing Stuff
- We need all the defeat stuff: crawl, jump, projectile, and the plain old
  strength stuff
- Immune to invincible, alwaysdoesdamage
- Talk about how enemies don't work for "bosses", and what to do about it
  (use Extra on an Obstacle?)
- Then discuss unusual uses of enemies, like at the bottom of a pit.
