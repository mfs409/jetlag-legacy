# Getting Started

In this tutorial, we will discuss how to get started using JetLag.  This
tutorial doesn't involve any programming.  It only focuses on getting your
computer set up to start writing games.  In the end, you should see the demo
game up and running.

## Required Software

You will need the following programs in order to work with JetLag.  Please note that we do not currently support development on a phone:

- A terminal and `git`
    - Every major operating system has at least one terminal program (some even
      have more than one).  It should not matter which terminal you use, but you
      will need to have the `git` program installed.  Briefly, `git` is a
      *source control* tool.  At a minimum, you'll use it to get a copy of the
      starter code.  In most cases, you'll want to use `git` to manage your code
      as you develop it.
- Node.js (`node`) and the Node Package Manager (`npm`)
    - JetLag uses `node` and `npm` to transform your code into a format that can
      be run inside a browser.
- A web browser
    - Any modern browser should suffice.  JetLag has been tested on Chrome,
      Edge, and Firefox.
- An editor
    - Strictly speaking, any program that can edit text will suffice.  However,
      since JetLag uses TypeScript, you will probably find that Visual Studio
      Code offers many benefits and makes your experience much nicer.
