## Dec 27 -- How To Program in JetLag

- JetLag is not the world's greatest game framework
    - But it's not that bad
    - HTML isn't evil, and for casual games, the cross-platform benefits
      outweight the costs.
    - And I understand 100% of it, so I can help you
- We're going to get the development software set up
- Then we're going to download and install the code
- Then we're going to see how to run a game
- Then we're going to write some code
    - See how Visual Studio Code works with you, and how it works against you
