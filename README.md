# JetLag: 2D Games for Web and Mobile

JetLag is a framework for making 2D games that run in desktop and mobile
browsers.  It is the evolution of LibLOL, and at a high level, it is faithful
to the spirit of LibLOL.  In particular:

* JetLag is designed for beginners
* JetLag strives to put all of the code for a level of the game in a single
  section of a single file

As an HTML5 project, JetLag differs from LibLOL in a few ways:

* It uses PIXI.js and Howler.js, and a different version of Box2D than
  LibGDX, so some names and features are a little bit different
* It uses TypeScript instead of Java, which leads to simpler, cleaner code

Note that JetLag still is a mobile-first framework.  It uses Hammer.js for
multi-touch and gesture support, and also enables accelerometer by default.

## Getting Started

Once you have downloaded JetLag, enter the JetLag directory and type `npm
install` to fetch all of the supporting code for JetLag.  Once you have done
that, you can run `npm start` to compile your code.  JetLag uses `esbuild`
for compilation, so every time you make a change, the code will recompile.
To test your game, open a browser and navigate to <http://localhost:7000>.

To develop a game, we recommend that you start by reading the code in
`src/game/game.ts`, to understand how JetLag works.  Then edit the first level
of that file to start creating your game.  An extensive set of tutorials are
under development.  More information will be available soon.  For now, you will
want to look at the v3-dev branch for examples.

To add images and sounds to JetLag, follow these steps:

1. Copy the image or sound file into the assets folder
2. Add the name of the file to the appropriate list in `src/game/game.ts`

That's it.  Once you follow those two steps, you can refer to the asset by its
filename in your code.

## JetLag Status

This is the "Entity-Component-System" (ECS) version of the JetLag game
development framework.  Older versions are available in branches, but will
not be maintained.  We reserve the right to change any and all APIs and
interfaces.

## Documentation

Documentation for JetLag is available on
[GitHub Pages](https://mfs409.github.io/jetlag/ "JetLag GitHub Pages")

## Coding Standards

JetLag is supposed to be a library that its users will hack for their own
purposes.  Consequently, we prefer that programmers preserve the structure we
have in the repository, where both `jetlag` and `game` are sub-folders of the
`src` folder.
